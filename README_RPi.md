Note: all versions of ROS discussed here are ROS2. 
So ROS assumes it is ROS2.


Installing ROS on the raspberry pi

Ubuntu for Raspberry Pi is available here.

Make sure to confirm that you have selected the correct version as described in REP-2000.

You can now install ROS 2 using the normal binary installation instructions for Ubuntu Linux.
