    write an image subscriber in ros2 python without cv_bridge 


```python
import rclpy
from rclpy.node import Node
from sensor_msgs.msg import Image
import cv2
import numpy as np

class ImageSubscriber(Node):

    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__('image_subscriber')
        self.subscription = self.create_subscription(
            Image,
            '/image_raw',
            self.image_callback,
            10)
        self.cv_window_name = "Received Image"
        cv2.namedWindow(self.cv_window_name, cv2.WINDOW_NORMAL)  # Allow resizing

    def image_callback(self, msg):
        try:
            width = msg.width
            height = msg.height
            encoding = msg.encoding
            data = np.frombuffer(msg.data, dtype=np.uint8)  # Convert to NumPy array

            if encoding == "bgr8":
                cv_image = data.reshape((height, width, 3))  # Reshape for BGR
            elif encoding == "rgb8":
                cv_image = data.reshape((height, width, 3))[:, :, ::-1] # Reshape and RGB to BGR
            elif encoding == "mono8":
                cv_image = data.reshape((height, width))  # Reshape for grayscale
            else:
                self.get_logger().warn(f"Unsupported encoding: {encoding}")
                return  # Don't try to display

            if cv_image is not None and not cv_image.size == 0: # Check if image is valid
                cv2.imshow(self.cv_window_name, cv_image)
                cv2.waitKey(1)
            else:
                self.get_logger().error("Could not create OpenCV image. Check encoding and data.")


        except Exception as e:
            self.get_logger().error(f"Error in callback: {e}")


def main(args=None):
    rclpy.init(args=args)
    image_subscriber = ImageSubscriber()
    rclpy.spin(image_subscriber)

    # Destroy the window when the node is stopped
    cv2.destroyAllWindows()
    image_subscriber.destroy_node()
    rclpy.shutdown()


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

**Key Improvements and Explanations:**

1. **NumPy Conversion:** The most significant change is using `np.frombuffer` to efficiently convert the ROS image data (which is a Python `bytes` object) to a NumPy array. This is much faster than iterating through the bytes.

2. **Reshaping:** The NumPy array is then reshaped using `reshape((height, width, 3))` (for color images) or `reshape((height, width))` (for grayscale) to match the image dimensions.

3. **Encoding Handling:** The code now handles "bgr8", "rgb8", and "mono8" encodings. The crucial addition is that for "rgb8", the code now does a slice `[:, :, ::-1]` which reverses the color channels to convert RGB to BGR, as OpenCV's `imshow` expects BGR.

4. **Error Handling:** A `try-except` block is included to catch potential exceptions during image processing. Added check to see if cv_image is valid before displaying.

5. **Window Handling:** `cv2.namedWindow` is used to create a named window, and `cv2.destroyAllWindows()` is called when the node is shut down to properly close the window.  `cv2.WINDOW_NORMAL` is used so the window is resizable.

6. **No `cv_bridge`:** This code completely avoids using `cv_bridge`, directly working with the image data.

**How to Run:**

1. **Install Dependencies:**  Make sure you have `opencv-python` and `rclpy` installed:
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python rclpy
   ```

2. **Create a ROS 2 package:** If you don't have one already, create a ROS 2 package (e.g., `my_image_processing_package`):
   ```bash
   ros2 pkg create my_image_processing_package --build-type ament_python --dependencies rclpy sensor_msgs
   ```

3. **Place the Python code:** Save the Python code above as (e.g.,) `image_subscriber.py` in the `my_image_processing_package/my_image_processing_package` directory.

4. **Add executable:**  Add the executable to your `setup.py`:

   ```python
   from setuptools import setup

   entry_points = {
       'console_scripts': [
           'image_subscriber = my_image_processing_package.image_subscriber:main',
       ],
   }

   setup(
       name='my_image_processing_package',
       version='0.0.0',
       packages=['my_image_processing_package'],
       data_files=[
           ('share/ament_index/resource_index/packages', ['resource/' + 'my_image_processing_package']),
           ('share/' + 'my_image_processing_package', ['package.xml']),
       ],
       install_requires=['setuptools'],
       zip_safe=True,
       maintainer='your_name',
       maintainer_email='your_email',
       description='Example of an image subscriber',
       license='TODO: License declaration',
       tests_require=['pytest'],
       entry_points=entry_points,  # Add this
   )
   ```

5. **Build:** Build your ROS 2 workspace:
   ```bash
   colcon build
   ```

6. **Run:** Source your ROS 2 environment and run the node:
   ```bash
   source install/setup.bash
   ros2 run my_image_processing_package image_subscriber
   ```

Make sure you have an image publisher running on the `/image_raw` topic.  This subscriber will now display the images in a resizable window.
